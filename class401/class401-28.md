[RecyclerView Reference](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/recyclerview#java)

RecyclerView efficiently displays large sets of data; it dynamically creates the elements when needed; it recycles the individual elements

It needs a `RecyclerView` class

The RecyclerView is added to the layout like any UI element

Each element in the RV is defined by the view holder object; no data exists when when the view holder is created then the RV binds it to the data. this is all called in the adapter

the layout manager arranges elements in the list;

STEPS TO IMPLEMENT RECYCLERVIEW:

1. Decided how the list layout looks
2. Design the look of each element in the list; extend the `ViewHolder` class; 
3. Defined the `Adapter` associated with `ViewHolder` views with `onCreateViewHolder()`, `onBindViewHolder()`, and `getItemCount`

**Questions:**

1. What makes a RecyclerView dynamic?
    * The ViewHolder makes the RecyclerView Dynamic because it is adjusted depending on the number of items
2. Share a screenshot of a recycler view in an application you use!
    * This is an example of looking at the settings in an application
