**Questions:**

1. What is a technology youâ€™ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?
    * JSON is something that I have used that uses SharedPreferences
2. Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.
    * Testing can identify and remove errors, it can prove the functionality of the program, it can define the limits of the program, as well as what is missing in a program. The most important one for me is to identify and remove errors because this can make code more efficient and clean.
3. Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.
    * Task and Back Stack is the same as stacking plates on top of each other. They have a last in first out functionality meaning the last one put in the stack will get pulled out the stack first.
