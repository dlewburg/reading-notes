## Don't Repeat Yourself and Consider the Rule of 3

[Repeat Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

[Rule of 3 Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming))

Don't repeat yourself is a principle that looks at reducing repetition in software development.

***DRY*** principle is applied successfully when a modification in a single element does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements and all logically related elements are also kept in sync

WET (write everything twice) solutions are common in multi-tiered architectures

DRY eliminates redundancy;

AHA (avoid hasty abstractions) is the principle of optimizing for change first then avoiding premature optimization.

**Questions:**

1. Are there any projects that youâ€™ve built during your time at Code Fellows (or prior) which could benefit from applying the Rule of Three to DRY up your code?
    *
2. Explain how you would dry up your code if you noticed that you are repeating the same logic in multiple places?
