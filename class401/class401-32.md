[Intro to Serverless](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-serverless-architecture-what-are-its-pros-and-cons-cc4b804022e9)

serverless needs less management because they are on the cloud; they have reduced cost -> cost is execution based; only accessed as private APIs through a gateway; it is paid per execution

serverless computing has a 300 second timeout limit therefore long running functions are not good; neither are applications with variable execution times nor when info is needed from and external source

scaling is automatic

FaaS (Functions as a Service) principles: complete management of servers, invocation based billing, and event-driven and instantaneously scalable

Key Properties: Independent functions, stateless, 

[AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)

AWS Amplify allows the development of front-end and mobile apps be hosted on AWS and use AWS functionality without expertise

[GraphQL Intro](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/data-modeling/)

Amplify automatically creates an Amazon DynamoDB database table annotated with `@model` in the GraphQL Schema. The `@model` also adds he helper fields createdAt and updatedAt to the type but they are read-only. Relationships can be created with `@hasOne`, `@hasMany`, `@belongsTo`, and `@manyToMany`

Amplify CLI generates the Todo database on amplify push and generates a GraphQL API to perform the CRUD and list operations for the model

**Questions:**

1. What makes an API RESTful?
    * The utilization of HTTP for UI
2. What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?
    * GraphQL allows data to be requested by need which gives control to the client but too many requests can be a problem
3. Describe “serverless” to a new 301 Code Fellows student.
    * Serverless is a server on the cloud that can be used and  does not need to be managed by a developer.
