# Class401-33 Reading Notes

[One-to-Many & Many-to-One Connections using GraphQL](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/data-modeling/#has-many-relationship)

> `@hasMany` and `@hasOne` directives do not support referencing a model which then references the initial model via the directives if DataStore is enabled

`@hasMany` give a unidirectional one-to-many relationship between two models. it configures a default secondary index on the related table to enable the query of the related model from the source model

`@index` can be used on the field in the related tabled to customize the secondary index; then a name can be provided, and a sortkey can be configured (if desired)

on the `@hasMany` configuration, pass the name value from the secondary index then the respective fields
