# Growth Mindset

Keeping up with the Growth Mindset is very crucial for my success in the tech field. My idea of Growth Mindset is keeping the idea that I will always have room to grow and that as long as I keep pushing forward, I will know more today than I did yesterday. This keeps me in a forever-student mindset. I know that I can be a master but I can never know it all.

Practice, practice, practice. I am not Allen Iverson and I do understand the need to practice because it ties into the continuous improvement that the growth mindset touches on. Tech is ever changing and I know that if I do not practice, it will make me a weak developer and put me behind. A 'what's next' attitude can contribute to being successful in this field. Practice can also help push me to be better but also ease workplace anxiety.

Challenges at works give me the power to know that I can improve and that is something that I want for myself.

After reviewing my emotional intelligence and biases, I am still in the same one to two point range. I have not change much, but I am more aware of the areas that need work. I am growing and I am aware that I am not a perfect person. I will continue to work on myself for improvements. I have the grit and tenacity to be able to success at my self-improvement.
