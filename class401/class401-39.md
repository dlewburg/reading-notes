The Google Play services location API can request the last known location of the user's device (current location = last known location) -> this uses the fused location provider

the fused location provider manages the underlying location technology and give the ability to specify requirements at a high level

NOTE: when the app is running the the background, access to location should be critical to the functionality of the app along with the proper disclosure to users

`getLastLocation()` method is used to make a single request for the location in the fused location provider. The method returns a Task that can be used to get a Location object with the lat and long coordinates of the location. The result can be null if the location services are disabled, the device never recorded the location, Google Play services on the device restarted along with no active fuse location provider the requested location after the services restarted

in order to have access to the fused location provider, the app must include the google play services; the location services must also request location permissions

To create the location services client, go to the `onCreate()` method and create an instance of the Fused Location Provider. How precise the location is depends on the permission settings in the app manifest

`FusedLocationProviderClient` gives a couple of methods to get the device's location:

1. `getLastLocation()` -> faster location estimate and minimizes battery usage but the location info may be out of date if no other clients actively used the location recently
2. `getCurrentLocation()` -> more accurate location consistently but can cause active location computation to occur; it is the safest opposed to managing location on own

`requestLocationUpdates()` can consume large amounts of power if the location is not available or if it isn't stopped correctly after obtaining a fresh location

**Questions:**

1. What are the benefits and downfalls of using the ‘getLastLocation()’ method to get your device’s location?
    * The benefit of this method is that is optimizes the battery power of the device. A downfall is that if the location of the device is not updated with another app then it likely will not have a current location and self-managing the location updates with another method can use large amounts of power.
2. What about the ‘getCurrentLocation()’ method?
    * This method does provide a fresh and accurate location of a consistent bases but can cause active location computation.
