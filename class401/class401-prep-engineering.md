**Questions:**

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
    * One thing that I can bring into this career that no one else can is my perspective on how to be a more effective and efficient company.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
    * Three things that I will start doing in order 'un-stick' myself is to take a break instead of trying to continue to push though it hoping I will guess the correct answer by trial and error. I also can take time to understand the problem so that I can know which approach to take in order to find the answer; when you know the problem, the solution becomes even more clear. Another thing I can do is tread debugging like another learning opportunity instead of allowing it to stress me out.
