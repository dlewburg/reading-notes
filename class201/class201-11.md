## HTML: Video and Audio Content

`<video>` and `<audio>` can be used to put videos and audio in HTML. ***Note: OVP like YouTube and online audio players like Soundcould make it easy to embed videos on webpages.***

Embedding a video looks like:
>        <video src="rabbit320.webm" controls>
>          <p>
>            Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a
>            <a href="rabbit320.webm">link to the video</a> instead.
>          </p>
>        </video>

the `src` element has a path to the desired video to embed

`controls` attribute helps with the start and stop of the media file at a minimum. The browser has it's own controls interface or one can be built with JS.

Inside the `<video>` tags there is fallback content that will display if the browser does not support the element

Audio and video tracks are encoded with their own type of codec, respectively. A movie uses a WebM container where the audio and video hold the format for the codec. The codecs help compress the large data files.

`<audio>` and `video` are basically the same with thr exception that there is nothing visually to give height and width, and there is no poster.

Questions:

1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
    * In the 2000s there were plug ins required to assist with the playing of audio and video files. These plugins are now obsolete and no longer needed. Now, online video providers and online audio providers that make it convenient to use videos and audio without a lot of bandwidth. They also offer an easy way to embed video on webpages.
2. Describe the use of the `src` and `controls` attributes in the `<video>` element.
    * The `src` attribute has the path to the desired video to embed and the `controls` attribute gives the user a way to stop, start, control the volume, etc. for a video/audio playback.
3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the `<video>` element?
    * Something can display just in case the browser does not support the `<video>` element
4. Write a very short story where `<audio>` and `<video>` are characters.
    * Once upon a time there were two elements that thought they were the same. When Mamma Programmer used them she used them separately until one day they were pug in a movie container. Here audio realized he was smaller than video and used less bandwidth and space. Here he knew he could be used more often.

## CSS: A Complete Guide to Grid

Grid layout uses two-dimensional layout based off a grid (x-axis and y-axis). Grid works well with flexbox. As with flex, the items can be placed in any order.

Grid container is where `display: grid` will be applied and is the direct parent of all the grid items. Grid items are the children of the grid container. The grandchildren and later are not grid items.

Grid lines are the lines that make up the grid structure and can be horizontal(row) or vertical(column).

Grid track is are the grid columns and rows. Grid area is the total space surrounded by four grid lines and is made up of any number of grid cells.

Grid cell is the space between two adjacent row lines and two adjacent column lines.

Questions:

1. How does Grid layout differ from Flex?
    * Grid is two-dimensional where it uses both the x and y axis to layout items where Flex uses one dimension, either the main axis (x) or the cross axis (y).
2.Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.
    * Grid container is where `display: grid` will be applied and is the direct parent of all the grid items. Grid items are the children of the grid container. The grandchildren and later are not grid items. Grid lines are the lines that make up the grid structure and can be horizontal(row) or vertical(column).

## JS: Responsive Images

With `srcset` and `sizes` in the `<img>` element, the browser can look at the device width, check to see which condition in the `sizes` is the first to return true, look at the slot size given, and load the image referenced in the `srcset` that has the same size of the slot (or the first image that is bigger than the chosen slot size).

Questions:

1. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?
    * The amount of bandwidth being used will not be wasted and resolution switching for optimum resolution.
2.Define the following `<img>` attributes `srcset` and `sizes`. Write an example of how they are used.
    * `srcset` defines the set of images and allow the browser to choose between and the size of each image; each image size info is separated by a comma. There is the filename, and the image's intrinsic width. `sizes` defines a set of media conditions and indicated which image size is the best to choose. There is a media condition and then the width of the slot the image will fill if conditions are true.
      * example:       > srcset="elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w, elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
                        > sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
         800px"
2. How is `srcset` more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?
    * `srcset` is more helpful for responsive images because it allows the use of supporting multiple display resolutions by allowing the browser to chose the best option.
