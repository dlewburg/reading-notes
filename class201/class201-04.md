## HTML Links

Hyperlinks allow documents and other resources to a webpage. Almost any part of a web document can be converted into into a hyperlink.

Anatomy of a link:

        <a href="link url">Name To Show for Link</a>

A `title` is another attribute outside href that can be used. It holds other info about the link.

Block level links are `<a>` and `<img>`

to link to a specific part of the document, first assign an `id` attribute to the element to be linked

Best Practice is to use clear wording for links

Email Links use `<a>` and `mailto:` scheme and can look like this:

        <a href="mailto:emailaddress">EmailDescription</a>

When emailing with links, certain parts of the email can be prefilled with link like the subject, bcc, cc, and body.

Questions:

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
    * `<a>`
2. The href attribute contains what information?
    * `href` contains the web address for the link
3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
    * Ways to ensure accessibility are to ensure that links have clear wording for links, not to repeat the URL on the page, keep link and links to out of the text, and keep link text short.

## CSS Layout: Normal Flow and Positioning

Normal flow is how a elements are laid out on a webpage without changes.

The **BEST** way to start a webpage is to starting with a well structured document that is readable in normal flow.

Block-level elements fill all the inline space of the parent element; they are laid out in the block flow direction where each element will appear on a new line under the previous one, separated by margins. They are laid out vertically

Inline elements are the size of the content. ***NOTE: width or height cannot be set with the exception of images***. These elements sit on the same line with any wrapped content just as long as there is space in the parent block element; if space runs out then it moves to the next line.

Inline elements can behave like a block element if it is changed into one with `display: block` or `display: inline-block`

Positioning allows elements to be taken out of the normal document flow and make the behavior different; basically make unique results by overriding document flow. This is done with the `position` property

Static position is the default and means it is in the normal document flow position.

`position: relative;` allows the final position to be moved. `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are used with `position` to move the element (px, mm, rems, % can all be used)

`position: absolute;` helps with isolating from other (i.e. drag and drop, pop up boxes, control menu, rollover panel, etc.)

  > If no ancestor elements have their position property explicitly defined, then by default all ancestor elements will have a static position. The result of this is the absolutely positioned element will be contained in the initial containing block.

`z-index` can be used to change the stacking order of the absolute positioned elements that works on the z-axis of a webpage. Everything starts at (0,0); a positive value moves it up and a negative value moves it down.

Fixed Positioning works similar to absolute positioning but absolute positioning fixes an element in place to it nearest positioned ancestor and fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. This is only altered with `transform` property has a value other than none.

Fixed Position can be used to create menus that are always visible no matter how much scrolling is done.

`position: sticky` is relatively new and is a mix of relative and fixed position. It allows an element that is positioned to act relatively positioned until the scrolling reaches a certain threshold then it becomes fixed.

Questions

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
    * Normal flow is how a webpage is laid out without an CSS applied and is designed to make a readable document.
2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
    * Block-elements all start on a new line were inline elements stay on the same line until it is filled up before starting on a new line. Block-level aligned vertically where inline aligns horizontally. Block-level has margins that can be edited where inline fills the entire content area.
3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
    * Static position is the default
4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
    * Absolute positioning allows the isolation of the element where it can be moved on the page without interfering with the other elements; it can allow overlapping. They can display outside the `<html>` element and moved to the initial viewport.
5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
    * The key difference is where the the element is fixed relative to. Fixed positioning uses viewport where absolute positioning uses its ancestor element.

## JavaScript Functions

Functions allow a piece of code that performs a single task to be stored to reuse.

Any JavaScript structure that uses parentheses are functions outside of built in structures

Invoking a function is the same thing as running or executing the code.

Functions can exist within other functions.

Parameters are sometimes needed in functions before invoking them and are placed inside the function's parentheses. Parameters and arguments are the same thing. Multiple parameters are separated by a comma. But parameters are not always required; the function will go to it's default behavior without them.

Optional parameters with a function can use the assignment operator after the name of the parameter followed by the default value. Anonymous functions do not have a name and are used when a function expects to receive another function.

Variables and things inside a function do no exist outside the function. Variables outside the functions are top level and can be access anywhere in the code.

Questions

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
    * A function declaration is making the actual function. Invoking the function is a separate action where it is executed.
2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
    * Parameters and arguments are the same thing.

### Miscellaneous Pair Programming

Pair programming allows programmer to collaborate. It also can help programmers develop listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. This level of collaboration can help with greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, job interview readiness, and work environment readiness.

Questions:

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
    * The first benefit of pair programming is that you can have greater efficiency. I love to be efficient and to work smarter and not harder. It can also benefit my coding journey by improving my work environment readiness not only by knowing how to code with others but to understand the jargon of coding and how to better communicate what is being done.

## Things I want to Know More About

I would like to understand the scope of viewport and where is it used and how it is manipulated.
