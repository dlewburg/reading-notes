## CSS Transforms

`transform` property has 2D and 3D settings that each have their own respective individual property values. The property can alter the size, position, and change elements. Overall, there is not a lot of browser support for this property.
The property can be written out as `transform: value:`

The property has several vendor prefixes that go in front of the property; (i.e. `-webkit-; -moz-; -o-;) that are used to get the best support across the browsers.

The 2D works on the x and y-axis (horizontal and vertical planes). More in depth about 2D values:

* `rotate` value can be used here to rotate an element clockwise (with a positive value) or counter-clockwise (negative value). The point of rotation is the center of the element. This will also all the box to rotate 360 degrees horizontally.
* The `scale` value can change the size of an element; default value is 1 so 0.01 -0.99 makes it smaller and 1.01 and up makes the element larger; also the height and width can be scaled with `scaleX` and `scaleY` values. They can be done with the `transform: scale (x-axis value, y-axis value);`
* `translate` value pulls and pushes an element without interrupting normal flow of the document (like `position: relative;`). Just like `scale` the x and y positions can be changed separately. This value usually uses px or % for measurement. Positive values push the element down and to the right and negative values pull the element up and to the left.

The 3D works on the x, y, and z axis which helps give depth.
