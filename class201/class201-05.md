## HTML Images

`<img>` is used to put images in a webpage and needs `src` and `alt` attributes within it. The `src` points to the image and the `alt` is the textual description that will show if the image does not load.

Hosting own images within the same server as the HTML file is best practice

`<figure>` and `<figcaption>` are a good way to add an image and a caption to HTML; these elements create a semantic container; ***NOTE: the figure does not have to be an image***

images can also be added via CSS with `background-image` property and the other `background-*` controls where the images goes. These images are typically used for decoration. Anatomy looks like:

        p{
          background-image: url("theImageURL");
        }

Common Image File Types:

* APNG - best for lossless animation sequences; ideal for basic animations that do not need to sync to other things
* AVIF - has high performance and royalty free image format
* GIF - good for simple images and animations
* JPEG - good for lossy compression of still images
* PNG - preferred for more precise reproduction of source images or when transparency is needed
* SVG - vector image format; best used for interface elements, icons, etc and has to be drawn accurately at different sized
* WebP - excellent for images and animated images; has better compression but is not well supported

[Image File Types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types) shows more details on each image file type and what they can be used for.

Photographs are best as JPEG and WebP. PNG is best for icons. Screenshots best is PNG. Diagrams, drawings,and charts are best with SVG.

`<picture>` and `<source>` elements can provide a way to have a fallback image file type.

Questions:

1. What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?
    * `alt` helps with accessibility, where someone use uses a screen reader can be able to know the description of the image on the screen or even if the image type is not supported. If my I get an email that has restrictions and cannot support images, then I will see the `alt` text.
2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
    * Accessibility of Images can be improved with the use of an `alt` attribute or adding a `figcaption`.
3. Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document.
    * A figure element would be useful in a webpage where have an item for sale on a web page and want to include a description of the sale item.
4. Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
    * SVG can be scaled to the desired size whereas a GIF is harder to scale.
5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
    * I would use a PNG image type because it is the most lossless and highly compatible.

## CSS Color and Styling HTML Text Elements

All HTML elements can have color applied to it. `color` property defines the foreground color and the `background-color` property defines the background color. Most elements can use this.

Text is altered with `color`, `background-color`, `text-shadow`, `text-decoration`, `text-decoration-color`, `text-emphasis-color`, and `caret-color`.

Boxes have ways to edit the borders, use `background-color`, `column-rule-color`, `outline-color`.

Borders can be around any element and lets you configure everything. Styling properties include `border-color`, `border-block-start-color` and `border-block-end-color`, & `border-inline-start-color`, `border-inline-end-color`.

Canvas APIs, SVGs, and WebGLs allow the use of color

There are RGB values which are identified as Hexadecimal Strings, RGB Functional Notation uses an alpha channel component for more opaque colors and is identified with `rgb()` function. HSL is most preferred and it uses the `hsl()` function in CSS. `hwb()` is another.

Filling the content in the  content box fills from left to right until the end before it moved to the next line and flows to the end again.

When font styling, all text will be the same with the exception with styling done on text wrapped in a `<span>` with class or id name or any that uses pseudo elements.

`font-family` property can change the font for the text. The font can only be applied if it is on the machine.

`serif`, `sans-serif`, `monospace`, `cursive`, and `fantasy` are popular web fonts.

font stacks can be used to give the browser options for font if the primary choice is not available.

Font size takes after the size of the parent element starting from the root element. The standard `font-size` is 16px.

The `font-style` is used to turn italic on or off. The `font-weight` sets the boldness of the text. `text-transform` to set font transformation. `text-decoration` set/unset decorations on fonts. `text-shadow` property applies drop shadows to the text.

`text-align` controls how the text is aligned with the current box. `line-height` sets the line height. `letter-spacing` and `word-spacing` adjusts the spacing around letters and words respectively.

1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
    * The background colors are just what it sounds like, it is in the background. It is basically the color of wall of the webpage. The foreground would be any text you see against the background. You can think of the foreground as pictures on the wall.
2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
    * I would use a color picker to find a color scheme to fit what my friend is looking for on his webpage. I would also attempt to apply a theme based on what the webpage offers.
3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
    *
4. What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements?
    * `font-size` adjusts the size of the text on the page. The `font-weight` adjusts the boldness of the font and `font-style` adjusts the italics.
5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an `h1` element.
    * Spacing can be placed around the character in an `<h1>` with `letter-spacing` and  `word-spacing` properties.
