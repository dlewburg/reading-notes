Code Fellows Notes 

Hello! My name is Dasha and ***WELCOME*** to my *GitHub* Page.  I'm new to the world of coding and have a lot to learn before I can master anything

#### Growth Mindset 

_What Does Growth Mindset Mean?_

The Growth Mindset is about continuous growth and how to overcome roadblocks in learning.  It gives the idea that learning anything is possible as long as you can believe that with tenacity and persistence, you can achieve your goals.

_How to Keep Myself In a Growth Mindset?_

1. Student Mindset
    - Remind myself that there is no time-limit on how long it takes me to learn and understand concepts 
2. Learn from Criticism 
    - All criticism is constructive that I can learn and build from
3. Peers Are a Knowledgebase
    - What you cannot google can be learned from those around you
