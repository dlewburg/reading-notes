# Thoughts and Observations

*What did the exercise teach you?*

I learned how git and my terminal can communicate with each other to update any changes made to my files. I also learned that each version that I changed is saved on my GitHub Repo and can be access anytime.  

I also learned that I tend to put and extra space at the end of each line as well as extra unnecessary spaces within my Markdown syntax.

I would like to know how to revert back to an older version just in case any changes in the new versions break something.
