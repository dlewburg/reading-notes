# More CRUD

## CRUD Basics

CRUD as an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. This is a concept that represents the four basic functions that models should be able to do and are needed to implement a persistence shortage application. CRUD should be used in the initial stages of development

CRUD corresponds to HTTP methods in a web server:

Create --> POST
Read   --> GET
Update --> PUT
Delete --> DELETE

Update/Delete uses /:id to target the resource

**Questions:**

1. Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?
    * PUT for the entire resource or PATCH or part of it
2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter?
    * Put/Patch and Delete use the ID parameter to target the resource

**Questions:**

1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
    * On the backend, the REST uses the POST/GET/PUT/DELETE to perform the actions that CRUD stands for on the backend for endpoint creations and pulling it in on the frontend
2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
    * Install server baseline package with installs and requires on each file, create a schema to define what is needed in the file, create data in JSON with post and send it over to the database, create endpoints and ensure the data can be read from database with get, be sure to include the async/await on the REST endpoint functions.
