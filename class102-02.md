# Coder's Computer Reading Assignment

## Command Line

Typically uses line interface over what is typically seen which is the graphic user interface (GUI).  

Command line is needed to streamline the use of the computer's interface.  This will tie in to how we code.  

Macs use Terminal; Linux uses Utilities; Windows uses a RDP for SSH (i.e. PuTTy)

***TIP***
* Commands are stored in a history that you can use the up&down arrow keys to navigate where the left and right arrow keys can be used to edit the command 

### Navigation in Terminal

* pwd: **print working directory** 
  * helps find current location
  
* ls: **list**
  * list of folders at current location
  * items with \[] means whatever in it is optional
 
* ls -a
  * lists contents ALL contents of a directory

* file
  * obtains info about the file type or directory 
 
* cd
  * changes directories (essentially folders) 
  * will take you back home if there aren't any additional directions to tell it where to navigate to 

### Paths

There are absolute paths that specify a location from the root

Relative paths specify a location where you are currently in the system

***TIP***

* \~ shortcut to home directory
* \. reference to current directory
* \... moves you back two directories

### Other Little Notes

If any file name has spaces, enclose the entire name in quotes (single)

**EVERYTHING IS A FILE**

**It is Case Sensitive**

Backslash \ can be used to cancel out the syntax meaning of a character
