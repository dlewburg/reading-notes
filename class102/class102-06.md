## Things I want to Know More About

I am new to JavaScript and looking to learn whatever I can about the topic.  

I did attempt to jump to a portion of the screen with input from the user with this line of code tailored to my specific attributes:
    document.getElementById("jump_to_this_location").scrollIntoView({behavior: 'smooth'});

but this did not work for my live site. Please help.
