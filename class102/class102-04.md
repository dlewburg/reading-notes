## HTML

Basic Anatomy of HTML File

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en-US">
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8" />
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
            <title>My test page</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />
        </body>
        <footer>
        </footer>
    </html>

* \<!DOCTYPE> is a MANDATORY declaration on page to make sure it behaves correctly
* \<html> element is known as the root and will wrap the contents of the entire page
* \<head> element contains info about the page but will NOT display on the page. Info here is used by search engines
* \<meta charset="UTF"> element sets the page to use this common characters used
* \<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"> element ensure page is the width of user's device
* \<title> element sets the title of the page that will display in the tab and when it is bookmarked
* \<body> element contains all content to be seen by the user when page is visited

\<img src="" alt=""/> is a self closing tag

\<!--   --> is used to comment out info within the tag

\<h1-h6> are used for headings

\<p> element is used for paragraphs and is a block element

\<a href="">LinkName></a> is for creating links

Elements can be nested within one another
